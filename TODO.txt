- Add the bst header to all the files 
  and a help or quick discription 
- test MEG on sphere model
- add plot of the electric field

- add way to display and/or load DTI data


- parrallelisation of the computation // use multi thread
it seems that is possibel to add the threads to the duneuro ... need checking. 
cfg.numberOfThreads = '2';
driver.apply_meg_transfer(transfer_matrix, dipoles, cfg);

- segmentation with fieltrip pipline ==> interessant et rapide

- generate hexa mesh
- write the hexa files for duneruo 
- display hexa mesh
check why the hexa are not connected with A0206 :
it seems that the hexa mesh, the whole are accepted ... I'm not sure why 

gmsh -h  : 
check the option of refining the mesh and how to gmesh for tetra meshand hexa meshing

- which model is better ... tetra or hexamodel


- Mix between the roast segmentation and johannes hexamesh generator
- convert tetra to hexa et visversa
- add header and help for all functions

- Check the MEG with and witout outer layers.

- Optimisation ... writer functions = : dipoles, electrodes, coils , orientation could be combined in one function
- Increase the resolution simnibs headreco later....for the tetra mesh 

- there is probably an error on the way to export the lf_meg ... check with Juan- work on the EEG/MEG combined method is the head is not all considered.
